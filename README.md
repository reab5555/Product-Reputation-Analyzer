# Product Reputation Profiler (PRP)
The purpose of this tool is to perform an in-depth analysis of the reputation profile on social networks which includes opinions, sentiments and atitudes towards a certain product, using Large Language Model and Prompt Engineering.

## Description
Social networks contain valuable information about user experiences of using a particular product - such as problems, malfunctions, sentiments, general issues and any other type of criticism. This information is important for businesses that want to understand what internet users or customers on social networks thinks about their current product on the market, so that they can improve it.

The first step is to extract data from a social network that contain posts or comments mentioning a keyword of a certain product - this can be done through requests from official API services the social networks provide (Twitter, Facebook or Reddit for example). this data is then "fed" into the algorithm as input. it includes the content of the posts or comments, dates, usernames, number of views, number of shares, etc.

Our tool is using a Large Language Model (Gemini Pro) that extracts unique KPI indicators from the data in order to provide relevant and important insights for a product name. Besides those KPI indicators, it also extracts main criticisms toward the product. by utilizing the Large Language Model, it collects all the criticisms and lists the most frequently mentioned problems or issues the users or customers mention.   
   
We also did the following: we attached or joined the company's stock data to the existing data by month, so that the stock value is associated to all the texts written that month which mention the product. This way we can also find out if certain KPIs are related to the stock value of the company that owns that product (by calculating correlations).
   
At this point, the algorithm only supports the social network Twitter (X).

Here are the algorithm steps:    
1. Extracting data from one of the social networks using the official API service (posts, comments, tweets, usernames, dates, views, likes, shares, etc.).
2. Utilizing AI/LLM with Prompt Engineering for extracting criticisms about the product from posts or comments.
3. Utilizing AI/LLM with Prompt Engineering for extracting sentiments and emotions of user's posts or comments mentioning their experience with the product.
4. Clustering the criticsms into N-number of the most frequent topics (issues, problems, etc.).
5. Assembling a report with the list of the main problems, issues, or criticisms and providing unique KPIs metrics.

## Algorithm steps
Loading fetched Dataset -> Cleaning texts -> Extracting all Criticisms and Sentiments -> Summarizing the Criticisms into main topics and Analyzing KPIs

### Available KPI list (Twitter/X):
#### Activity:
- Volume:   
  represents the total amount of activity on the social network (views + quotes + replies + retweets + bookmarks + favorites)
- Engagement:   
  represents the total amount of user engagement (quotes + replies + retweets)
- Influence:   
  Represents the level of influence through the amount of the tweets that mention the product together with the number of the users number of followers (Average Followers Count Ã— Tweet Count)
#### Sentiments:
- Positive Sentiment:   
  How much the tweets are reflecting a positive attitude toward the product (a probability number 0-1)
- Negative Sentiment:   
  How much the tweets are reflecting a negative attitude toward the product (a probability number 0-1)
#### Emotions:
- Anticipation:   
  How much the tweets represent anticipation toward the product or other features related to this product (a scrore number from 0 to 100)
- Curiosity:   
  How much the tweets represent curiosity (a scrore number from 0 to 100)
- Surprise:   
  How much the tweets represent reactions of surprise (a scrore number from 0 to 100)

### Notes
In order to get a sentiment probability or score for each text we need a large language model that will also understand the context and the sentiment that is directed solely towards the product keyword, as this avoid any general impression the text express that is not related to the product itself. Only Large Language Models able to link the product name appearing in the text to the specific sentiment towards it.   
   
Note that we use the Gemini Pro 1.5 model by Google through which we send API requests. however, it is also possible to use different local LLM models such as Llama, Mistral, etc. but we have not yet tried this and have not tested their outputs. also keep in mind that it must use a model with a capability of receiving a maximum tokens number of at least 100,000 in order to receive all the texts at once for summarizing them.  
   
To run, use Main.py - please enter the name of your google cloud project if needed and the number of the desired topics or criticisms to be listed.    

## Demonstration
We would like to demonstrate here some of the results we received from the algorithm. we extracted two datasets containing tweets that mention iPhone 15 Pro Max and the Tesla Model 3. Both are very popular products in the market. We extracted data from different time ranges. The data for the Tesla Model 3 is tweets from 2023, with each month containing the same amount of tweets or samples. For the iPhone 15 Pro Max, we extracted tweets from the period between September 2023 (the product's release date) and December 2023. In total, the two datasets contain about 4000 tweets each.

3. Influence (orange line): Beginning with a very high value of 4,577,758,611, there is a steady decline to 404,985,950 by month 12 (December), similar to the previous influence graph for the iPhone 15 Pro Max.   
   
Overall, the sentiment dynamics for both products show that anticipation and curiosity tend to increase towards the end of the year, which could correlate with product release cycles, marketing campaigns, or seasonal events. The Influence metric for the iPhone and the Surprise metric for the Tesla indicate there were periods of heightened reaction, possibly due to specific events or announcements.   

### Impact on the Product's Stock value

The data presented appears to be from a series of statistical analyses, including correlation and regression models, focusing on Twitter data for the Tesla Model 3 and its relationship with TSLA stock values.   
   
The two scatterplots compare the TSLA stock closing value with Twitter sentiments about the Tesla Model 3 for the year 2023.   
    
1. Product Positive Sentiment vs TSLA Stock: This plot shows a positive correlation (r = 0.436), suggesting that as the positive sentiment regarding the Tesla Model 3 on Twitter increases, the TSLA stock value tends to increase as well.   
     
2. Anticipation vs TSLA Stock: This plot shows a slightly stronger correlation (r = 0.473) compared to positive sentiment, again indicating that higher stock prices may be associated with greater anticipation regarding the Tesla Model 3 on Twitter.   
   
Pearson's Correlations Table:   
The Pearson's correlations table displays the correlation coefficients between various sentiment measures and the mean revenue. Notable coefficients include:   
- Engagement_sum (r = 0.358)   
- Influence_sum (r = 0.402)   
- Positive_mean (r = 0.442)   
- Negative_mean (r = -0.392)   
- Anticipation_mean (r = 0.474)   
   
The positive values suggest a direct relationship with revenue mean, where higher sentiments or emotions correlate with higher revenue, except for Negative_mean (negative sentiment) which has an inverse relationship.   
   
Regression Coefficients Table:   
This table provides a summary of the linear regression model coefficients, with t-statistics and p-values. It appears to be analyzing the impact of various Twitter sentiment measures on revenue.   
   
- Volume_sum (Volume) has a negative coefficient, but the p-value (0.067) indicates this is not statistically significant at the 0.05 level.   
- Anticipation_mean (Anticipation) has a positive and statistically significant impact on revenue (p = 0.015).   
   
Model Summary:
The model summary shows an R-squared value of 0.406, suggesting that approximately 40.6% of the variance in the revenue mean can be explained by the independent variables in the model. The adjusted R-squared is 0.298, which accounts for the number of predictors in the model. RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) provides an estimate of the standard deviation of the residuals, in this case, it is 3.754.   
   
Overall, these analyses suggest that there is a moderate positive relationship between TSLA stock values and the sentiment or emotion on Twitter regarding the Tesla Model 3. Anticipation seems to be a strong predictor of revenue, and the positive sentiment has a meaningful but less strong relationship with revenue. Negative sentiment has an inverse relationship, as expected.
